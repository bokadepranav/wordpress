<p>Soya has become one of the most controversial food items these days. Is it rich in healthy omega 3 or it is loaded with harmful estrogen? Various concerns regarding some soy products have surfaced in the recent years, thus bringing back the love for soya chunks! Soya chunks are to a vegetarian what chicken breast is to a non-vegetarian- a great source of protein! However, that is not the only nutrient soya chunks have to offer. A plus point is that they are ridiculously easy to add to your diet. Want to know more? Keep reading!</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-left">What are the benefits of having soya chunks?</h2>



<p>Soya chunks pack numerous benefits and enable faster muscle building and metabolism. They are great for the health of bone, hair and skin health. According to a 2015 study published in the journal Molecules, it was found that soy chunks can efficiently lower the levels of bad cholesterol in the body and protect the heart from ailments. The study also discovered that soya chunks stop excess fat from accumulating around the organs, thus promoting weight-loss. The chunks are loaded with fibre, thus allowing the food to pass slowly from the system and keeping you full for longer.</p>

<h2>What should you remember while having soya chunks?</h2>



<p>Having too much soy products can increase estrogen and uric acid levels in your body, thus contributing to numerous health problems such as water retention, acne, weight gain, mood swings, bloating etc. Increase of uric acid may damage your liver and cause joint pain. Therefore, it is recommended to only have 25 to 30 grams of soya chunks in a day. Moderation is key!</p>
